Alignment

-D 20	      give up extending after <int> failed extends in a row (15)
-R 3          for reads w/ repetitive seeds, try <int> sets of seeds (2)
-N 1          max # mismatches in seed alignment; can be 0 or 1 (0)
-L 20         length of seed substrings; must be >3, <32 (22)
-i S,1,0.50   interval between seed substrings w/r/t read len (S,1,1.15)
--end-to-end  entire read must align; no clipping (on)
-k 15         report up to <int> alns per read; MAPQ not meaningful
--no-unal     suppress SAM records for unaligned reads
