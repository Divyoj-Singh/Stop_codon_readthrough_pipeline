Creating_the_transcriptome.py:
Takes following folders as input:
cdna,cds,ncrna,pep along with the fasta file in them.
creates folder gene_details, gene_files and output_files as output and stores the files in them.

Following is the terminal output;
Extracting the gene details for:  cdna
Extracting the gene details for:  cds
Extracting the gene details for:  ncrna
Extracting the gene details for:  pep
